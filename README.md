Banana Muffins-
My staple go-to recipe for overripe bananas! The key to super moist muffins is to mix the batter until only just combined, and not to over bake.

Ingredients-
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon salt
1 dash ground nutmeg
3 very ripe bananas
½ cup white sugar
⅓ cup butter, melted
¼ cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ cup chopped walnuts (Optional)

Directions-
Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin.

Step 2
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a small bowl.

Step 3
Mash bananas in a large bowl. Mix in white sugar, melted butter, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Fold in flour mixture until just combined. Fold walnuts into the batter.

Step 4
Divide batter evenly among the muffin cups.

Step 5
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
